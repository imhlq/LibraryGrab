# Library Grab

## What is this?

One of the python programs. 

Two things it do:

1. Grab **[ID, Rate, Actor, Genre, Date]** information from a ~~movies-library~~ website and save the results in `sqlite3` database
2. Output the data with the given condition

## How to use it?

**main.py** is the grab file, you can use `python3 main.py` in terminal to run. It will cost 1-10 mins depends on which kind of data you want. (Setting in the `main()` function which noted `# which data you want?` )

**luck.py** is output file. When you want to display and use the data in some way, just adjust the *condition filter* to get the output.
